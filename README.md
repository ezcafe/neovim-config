	y		      Yes; make this change.
	n		      No; skip this match.
	a		      All; make this change and all remaining ones without
			      further confirmation.

- `%s/\s\+$//` remove whitespace at the end of every line (This finds white space characters (\s), 1 or more of them (\+), before the end-of-line ($))

To replace text in many files, we can use [Record and Playback feature](https://neovim.io/doc/user/usr_12.html#12.1)
